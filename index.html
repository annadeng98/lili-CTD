<h1> Welcome to Flexagon.co </h1>
</div>
<h3> Flexagon.co is a website designed to help and teach people how to make<br>
  Hexaflexagons so they don't have to buy over-priced ones on the internet </h3>
<h1> Tri-Hexaflexagon </h1>
<h3> What you will make:
Learn how to make a flexagon, a most fascinating geometric toy!<br>
It looks like an ordinary paper hexagon with a front and a back, but hidden inside,<br>
 is a third side (or face) that can be brought to the outside by flexing the paper.<br>
Flexagons are folded paper polygons that have the neat feature of changing faces as<br>
they are flexed. There are many types of flexagons. The names of flexagons tell the<br>
type of polygon and the number of faces. In this project we make a tri-hexaflexagon, a<br>
six-sided polygon (hexagon) with three faces (tri). </h3>

    <h1> Step-by-Step Tutorial </h1>
    <h3> Step 1: Choose a Pattern and Print It </h3>
    <p> Choose a tri-hexaflexagon to make. Download and print the pattern.<br>
    Choose a design that prints in color, or select a black & white (B&W)<br>
    pattern and use your creativity to add color and designs. You might want<br>
    to start with the pattern with numbers on each face—1, 2 and 3. The Dots<br>
    pattern coordinates with the dot patterns in the Geometric Solids craft project.<br> </p>

    <p> On the Stars pattern, half of the fold lines are marked on each side, so<br>
    you will need to score on both sides. It's best to make another pattern<br>
    first for experience in scoring and folding.<br> <p>

    <p> On the Equilateral triangle patterns, the fold lines are thicker than the<br>
    lines for the individual, smaller triangles. Select the black & white (B&W)<br>
     Equilateral pattern to color the triangles as you choose.<br> <p>
    <h3>   Step 2: Color Pattern (optional) </h3> <br>
      <p> Color the pattern template as you like with markers, colored pencils or <br>
        crayons. You don't need to color the glue tabs marked with '*'. <br>

      <h3> Step 3: Cut </h3>
       Cut around the pattern on the outline. Try to make the cuts very <br>
        straight and accurate. There will be one piece with twenty triangles.<br>
       <h3>Step 4: Double Fold in half and glue</h3>
       Make a double thickness by folding the pattern piece in half lengthwise<br>
        and glue. To make a sharp, straight fold, first score on the fold line.<br>

       To score: Use a ruler and the empty ballpoint pen (or bone folder) to<br>
        make an indent along the fold lines.<br>

       <h3> Step 5: Fold Tri-hexaflexagon - fold and glue </h3> <br>
       Score and fold back and forth on all the solid lines. Do this for each<br>
        of the 10 triangles of the tri-hexaflexagon.<br>

      Place the folded pattern with the side without glue tabs facing up, and<br>
      the end with a green (2) triangle to the left. Fold back on the line between<br>
        the yellow (3rd) and blue (4th) triangles (1 and 3)—four yellow triangles (1s)<br>
        are together now. Fold back on the line between the yellow and blue triangles<br>
        (1 and 3). Now you should be able to see five yellow triangles (1s). Pull the <br>
        yellow triangle (1) forward that is behind the green triangle (2). There should <br>
        be six yellow triangles (1s) on top and a blue triangle (3) to the side. Fold the <br>
        blue triangle (3) back.<br>

       The two glue tabs marked with '*' are now face-to-face. Glue them together. <br>
       Wait for the glue to dry before flexing your flexagon.<br>

      <h3>Step 6: How to flex the tri-hexaflexagon</h3> <br>
       Fold the flexagon to bring together three alternate corners of the flexagon.<br>
        The top of the flexagon will pop open if there is a new face to reveal. If <br>
        it doesn't pop open, flatten the flexagon and try again with the other three<br>
         corners.

       As you flex the flexagon in this project, see if you can find all the possible<br>
      combinations of faces. The tri-hexaflexagon has three faces in three combinations.<br>

       That's it! Your flexagon is done!<br>
       Tri-hexaflexagon - patterned, plain and numbered <br>

    <h3> Design Ideas </h3> <br>
    There are tons of different designs out there and all of them are cool! try some out, see <br>
    how they work, and challenge yourself to make different, new designs! <br>

    <h3> Not Working? </h3>
    try to expiriment with how to fold it and make sure that there are 3 seperate openings and <br>
    not one opening all the way through the hexa-flexagon. <br>
